<h3>Beverley Nichols</h3>

<p>These poems are the very essence of the British spirit. They
are, to<br>
literature, what the bloom of the heather is to the Scot, and
the<br>
smell of the sea to the Englishman. All that is beautiful in the
old<br>
word "patriotism" ... a word which, of late, has been twisted to
such<br>
ignoble purposes ... is latent in these gay and full-blooded
measures.</p>

<p>But it is not only for these reasons that they are so valuable
to the<br>
modern spirit. It is rather for their tonic qualities that they
should<br>
be prescribed in 1934. The post-war vintage of poetry is the
thinnest<br>
and the most watery that England has ever produced. But here, in
these<br>
ballads, are great draughts of poetry which have lost none of
their<br>
sparkle and none of their bouquet.</p>

<p>It is worth while asking ourselves why this should be--why
these poems<br>
should "keep", apparently for ever, when the average modern poem
turns<br>
sour overnight. And though all generalizations are dangerous I
believe<br>
there is one which explains our problem, a very simple one....
namely,<br>
that the eyes of the old ballad-singers were turned outwards,
while the<br>
eyes of the modern lyric-writer are turned inwards.</p>

<p>The authors of the old ballads wrote when the world was young,
and<br>
infinitely exciting, when nobody knew what mystery might not lie
on the<br>
other side of the hill, when the moon was a golden lamp, lit by
a<br>
personal God, when giants and monsters stalked, without the
slightest<br>
doubt, in the valleys over the river. In such a world, what could
a man<br>
do but stare about him, with bright eyes, searching the horizon,
while<br>
his heart beat fast in the rhythm of a song?</p>

<p>But now--the mysteries have gone. We know, all too well, what
lies on<br>
the other side of the hill. The scientists have long ago puffed
out,<br>
scornfully, the golden lamp of the night ... leaving us in the
uttermost<br>
darkness. The giants and the monsters have either skulked away or
have<br>
been tamed, and are engaged in writing their memoirs for the
popular<br>
press. And so, in a world where everything is known (and
nothing<br>
understood), the modern lyric-writer wearily averts his eyes, and
stares<br>
into his own heart.</p>

<p>That way madness lies. All madmen are ferocious egotists, and
so are all<br>
modern lyric-writers. That is the first and most vital
difference<br>
between these ballads and their modern counterparts. The old<br>
ballad-singers hardly ever used the first person singular. The
modern<br>
lyric-writer hardly ever uses anything else.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>This is really such an important point that it is worth
labouring.</p>

<p>Why is ballad-making a lost art? That it <i>is</i> a lost art
there can<br>
be no question. Nobody who is painfully acquainted with the
rambling,<br>
egotistical pieces of dreary versification, passing for
modern<br>
"ballads", will deny it.</p>

<p>Ballad-making is a lost art for a very simple reason. Which
is, that we<br>
are all, nowadays, too sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought to<br>
receive emotions directly, without self-consciousness. If we
are<br>
wounded, we are no longer able to sing a song about a clean
sword, and a<br>
great cause, and a black enemy, and a waving flag. No--we must
needs go<br>
into long descriptions of our pain, and abstruse calculations
about its<br>
effect upon our souls.</p>

<p>It is not "we" who have changed. It is life that has changed.
"We" are<br>
still men, with the same legs, arms and eyes as our ancestors.
But life<br>
has so twisted things that there are no longer any clean swords
nor<br>
great causes, nor black enemies. And the flags do not know which
way to<br>
flutter, so contrary are the winds of the modern world. All is
doubt.<br>
And doubt's colour is grey.</p>

<p>Grey is no colour for a ballad. Ballads are woven from stuff
of<br>
primitive hue ... the red blood gushing, the gold sun shining,
the green<br>
grass growing, the white snow falling. Never will you find grey
in a<br>
ballad. You will find the black of the night and the raven's
wing,<br>
and the silver of a thousand stars. You will find the blue of
many<br>
summer skies. But you will not find grey.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>That is why ballad-making is a lost art. Or almost a lost art.
For even<br>
in this odd and musty world of phantoms which we call the
twentieth<br>
century, there are times when a man finds himself in a certain
place at<br>
a certain hour and something happens to him which takes him out
of<br>
himself. And a song is born, simply and sweetly, a song which
other<br>
men can sing, for all time, and forget themselves.</p>

<p>Such a song was once written by a master at my old school,
Marlborough.<br>
He was a Scot. But he loved Marlborough with the sort of love
which the<br>
old ballad-mongers must have had-the sort of love which takes a
man on<br>
wings, far from his foolish little body.</p>

<p>He wrote a song called "The Scotch Marlburian".</p>

<p>Here it is:--</p>

<p>  Oh Marlborough, she's a toun o' touns<br>
  We will say that and mair,<br>
  We that ha' walked alang her douns<br>
  And snuffed her Wiltshire air.<br>
  A weary way ye'll hae to tramp<br>
  Afore ye match the green<br>
  O' Savernake and Barbery Camp<br>
  And a' that lies atween!</p>

<p>The infinite beauty of that phrase ... "and a' that lies
atween"! The<br>
infinite beauty as it is roared by seven hundred young throats
in<br>
unison! For in that phrase there drifts a whole pageant of
boyhood--the<br>
sound of cheers as a race is run on a stormy day in March, the
tolling<br>
of the Chapel bell, the crack of ball against bat, the sighs of
sleep<br>
in a long white dormitory.</p>

<p>But you may say "What is all this to me? I wasn't at
Maryborough. I<br>
don't like schoolboys ... they strike me as dirty, noisy, and
usually<br>
foul-minded. Why should I go into raptures about such a song,
which<br>
seems only to express a highly debatable approval of a certain
method of<br>
education?"</p>

<p>If you are asking yourself that sort of question, you are
obviously in<br>
very grave need of the tonic properties of this book. For after
you have<br>
read it, you will wonder why you ever asked it.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I go back and back to the same point, at the risk of boring
you to<br>
distraction. For it is a point which has much more "to" it than
the<br>
average modern will care to admit, unless he is forced to do
so.</p>

<p>You remember the generalization about the eyes ... how they
used to look<br>
<i>out</i>, but now look <i>in</i>? Well, listen to this....</p>

<p>  <i>I'm</i> feeling blue,<br>
  <i>I</i> don't know what to do,<br>
  'Cos <i>I</i> love you<br>
  And you don't love <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>The above masterpiece is, as far as I am aware, imaginary. But
it<br>
represents a sort of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of thousands of
lyrics<br>
which have been echoing over the post-war world. Nearly all these
lyrics<br>
are melancholy, with the profound and primitive melancholy of the
negro<br>
swamp, and they are all violently egotistical.</p>

<p>Now this, in the long run, is an influence of far greater evil
than one<br>
would be inclined at first to admit. If countless young men,
every<br>
night, are to clasp countless young women to their bosoms, and
rotate<br>
over countless dancing-floors, muttering "I'm feeling blue ...
<i>I</i><br>
don't know what to do", it is not unreasonable to suppose that
they will<br>
subconsciously apply some of the lyric's mournful egotism to
themselves.</p>

<p>Anybody who has even a nodding acquaintance with modern
psychological<br>
science will be aware of the significance of "conditioning", as
applied<br>
to the human temperament. The late M. Cou&eacute; "conditioned"
people into<br>
happiness by making them repeat, over and over again, the phrase
"Every<br>
day in every way I grow better and better and better."</p>

<p>The modern lyric-monger exactly reverses M. Cou&eacute;'s
doctrine. He makes<br>
the patient repeat "Every night, with all my might, I grow worse
and<br>
worse and worse." Of course the "I" of the lyric-writer is an
imaginary<br>
"I", but if any man sings "<i>I'm</i> feeling blue", often
enough, to a<br>
catchy tune, he will be a superman if he does not eventually
apply that<br>
"I" to himself.</p>

<p>But the "blueness" is really beside the point. It is the
<i>egotism</i><br>
of the modern ballad which is the trouble. Even when, as they<br>
occasionally do, the modern lyric-writers discover, to their<br>
astonishment, that they are feeling happy, they make the
happiness such<br>
a personal issue that half its tonic value is destroyed. It is
not, like<br>
the old ballads, just an outburst of delight, a sudden rapture at
the<br>
warmth of the sun, or the song of the birds, or the glint of
moonlight<br>
on a sword, or the dew in a woman's eyes. It is not an emotion so
sweet<br>
and soaring that self is left behind, like a dull chrysalis,
while the<br>
butterfly of the spirit flutters free. No ... the chrysalis is
never<br>
left behind, the "I", "I", "I", continues, in a maddening
monotone. And<br>
we get this sort of thing....</p>

<p>  <i>I</i> want to be happy,<br>
  But <i>I</i> can't be happy<br>
  Till <i>I've</i> made you happy too.</p>

<p>And that, if you please, is one of the jolliest lyrics of the
last<br>
decade! That was a song which made us all smile and set all our
feet<br>
dancing!</p>

<p>Even when their tale was woven out of the stuff of tragedy,
the old<br>
ballads were not tarnished with such morbid speculations. Read
the tale<br>
of the beggar's daughter of Bethnal Green. One shudders to think
what a<br>
modern lyric-writer would make of it. We should all be in tears
before<br>
the end of the first chorus.</p>

<p>But here, a lovely girl leaves her blind father to search for
fortune.<br>
She has many adventures, and in the end, she marries a knight.
The<br>
ballad ends with words of almost childish simplicity, but they
are words<br>
which ring with the true tone of happiness:--</p>

<p>  Thus was the feast ended with joye and delighte<br>
  A bridegroome most happy then was the young knighte<br>
  In joy and felicitie long lived hee<br>
  All with his faire ladye, the pretty Bessee.</p>

<p>I said that the words were of almost childish simplicity. But
the<br>
student of language, and the would-be writer, might do worse than
study<br>
those words, if only to see how the cumulative effect of
brightness and<br>
radiance is gained. You may think the words are artless, but
just<br>
ponder, for a moment, the number of brilliant verbal symbols
which are<br>
collected into that tiny verse. There are only four lines. But
those<br>
lines contain these words ...</p>

<p>Feast, joy, delight, bridegroom, happy, joy, young, felicity,
fair,<br>
pretty.</p>

<p>Is that quite so artless, after all? Is it not rather like an
old and<br>
primitive plaque, where colour is piled on colour till you would
say<br>
the very wood will burst into flame ... and yet, the total effect
is one<br>
of happy simplicity?</p>
<br><br>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>How were the early ballads born? Who made them? One man or
many? Were<br>
they written down, when they were still young, or was it only
after the<br>
lapse of many generations, when their rhymes had been sharpened
and<br>
their metres polished by constant repetition, that they were
finally<br>
copied out?</p>

<p>To answer these questions would be one of the most fascinating
tasks<br>
which the detective in letters could set himself. Grimm,
listening<br>
in his fairyland, heard some of the earliest ballads, loved
them,<br>
pondered on them, and suddenly startled the world by announcing
that<br>
most ballads were not the work of a single author, but of the
people at<br>
large. <i>Das Volk dichtet</i>, he said. And that phrase got him
into a<br>
lot of trouble. People told him to get back to his fairyland and
not<br>
make such ridiculous suggestions. For how, they asked, could a
whole<br>
people make a poem? You might as well tell a thousand men to make
a<br>
tune, limiting each of them to one note!</p>

<p>To invest Grimm's words with such an intention is quite
unfair.<br>
[Footnote:  For a discussion of Grimm's theories, together with
much<br>
interesting speculation on the origin of the ballads, the reader
should<br>
study the admirable introduction to <i>English and Scottish
Popular<br>
Ballads</i>, published by George Harrap &amp; Co., Ltd.]
Obviously a<br>
multitude of people could not, deliberately, make a single poem
any more<br>
than a multitude of people could, deliberately, make a single
picture,<br>
one man doing the nose, one man an eye and so on. Such a
suggestion is<br>
grotesque, and Grimm never meant it. If I might guess at what he
meant,<br>
I would suggest that he was thinking that the origin of ballads
must<br>
have been similar to the origin of the dance, (which was probably
the<br>
earliest form of aesthetic expression known to man).</p>

<p>The dance was invented because it provided a means of
prolonging ecstasy<br>
by art. It may have been an ecstasy of sex or an ecstasy of
victory ...<br>
that doesn't matter. The point is that it gave to a group of
people an<br>
ordered means of expressing their delight instead of just leaping
about<br>
and making loud cries, like the animals. And you may be sure that
as the<br>
primitive dance began, there was always some member of the tribe
a<br>
little more agile than the rest--some man who kicked a little
higher or<br>
wriggled his body in an amusing way. And the rest of them copied
him,<br>
and incorporated his step into their own.</p>

<p>Apply this analogy to the origin of ballads. It fits
perfectly.</p>

<p>There has been a successful raid, or a wedding, or some great
deed of<br>
daring, or some other phenomenal thing, natural or supernatural.
And now<br>
that this day, which will ever linger in their memories, is
drawing to<br>
its close, the members of the tribe draw round the fire and begin
to<br>
make merry. The wine passes ... and tongues are loosened. And
someone<br>
says a phrase which has rhythm and a sparkle to it, and the
phrase is<br>
caught up and goes round the fire, and is repeated from mouth to
mouth.<br>
And then the local wit caps it with another phrase and a rhyme is
born.<br>
For there is always a local wit in every community, however
primitive.<br>
There is even a local wit in the monkey house at the zoo.</p>

<p>And once you have that single rhyme and that little piece of
rhythm, you<br>
have the genesis of the whole thing. It may not be worked out
that<br>
night, nor even by the men who first made it. The fire may long
have<br>
died before the ballad is completed, and tall trees may stand
over the<br>
men and women who were the first to tell the tale. But rhyme and
rhythm<br>
are indestructible, if they are based on reality. "Not marble nor
the<br>
gilded monuments of princes shall outlive this powerful
rhyme."</p>

<p>And so it is that some of the loveliest poems in the language
will ever<br>
remain anonymous. Needless to say, <i>all</i> the poems are
not<br>
anonymous. As society became more civilized it was inevitable
that the<br>
peculiar circumstances from which the earlier ballads sprang
should<br>
become less frequent. Nevertheless, about nearly all of the
ballads<br>
there is "a common touch", as though even the most self-conscious
author<br>
had drunk deep of the well of tradition, that sparkling well in
which so<br>
much beauty is distilled.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>But though the author or authors of most of the ballads may be
lost in<br>
the lists of time, we know a good deal about the minstrels who
sang<br>
them. And it is a happy thought that those minstrels were
such<br>
considerable persons, so honourably treated, so generously
esteemed.<br>
The modern mind, accustomed to think of the singer of popular
songs<br>
either as a highly paid music-hall artist, at the top of the
ladder, or<br>
a shivering street-singer, at the bottom of it, may find it
difficult to<br>
conceive of a minstrel as a sort of ambassador of song, moving
from<br>
court to court with dignity and ceremony.</p>

<p>Yet this was actually the case. In the ballad of King Estmere,
for<br>
example, we see the minstrel finely mounted, and accompanied by
a<br>
harpist, who sings his songs for him. This minstrel, too, moves
among<br>
kings without any ceremony. As Percy has pointed out, "The
further we<br>
carry our enquiries back, the greater respect we find paid to
the<br>
professors of poetry and music among all the Celtic and Gothic
nations.<br>
Their character was deemed so sacred that under its sanction our
famous<br>
King Alfred made no scruple to enter the Danish camp, and was at
once<br>
admitted to the king's headquarters."</p>

<p><i>And even so late as the time of Froissart, we have
minstrels and<br>
heralds mentioned together, as those who might securely go into
an<br>
enemy's country.</i></p>

<p>The reader will perhaps forgive me if I harp back, once more,
to our<br>
present day and age, in view of the quite astonishing change in
national<br>
psychology which that revelation implies. Minstrels and heralds
were<br>
once allowed safe conduct into the enemy's country, in time of
war. Yet,<br>
in the last war, it was considered right and proper to hiss the
work of<br>
Beethoven off the stage, and responsible newspapers seriously
suggested<br>
that never again should a note of German music, of however
great<br>
antiquity, be heard in England! We are supposed to have
progressed<br>
towards internationalism, nowadays. Whereas, in reality, we have
grown<br>
more and more frenziedly national. We are very far behind the age
of<br>
Froissart, when there was a true internationalism--the
internationalism<br>
of art.</p>

<p>To some of us that is still a very real internationalism. When
we hear a<br>
Beethoven sonata we do not think of it as issuing from the brain
of a<br>
"Teuton" but as blowing from the eternal heights of music whose
winds<br>
list nothing of frontiers.</p>

<p>Man <i>needs</i> song, for he is a singing animal. Moreover,
he needs<br>
communal song, for he is a social animal. The military
authorities<br>
realized this very cleverly, and they encouraged the troops,
during the<br>
war, to sing on every possible occasion. Crazy pacifists, like
myself,<br>
may find it almost unbearably bitter to think that on each side
of<br>
various frontiers young men were being trained to sing themselves
to<br>
death, in a struggle which was hideously impersonal, a struggle
of<br>
machinery, in which the only winners were the armament
manufacturers.<br>
And crazy pacifists might draw a very sharp line indeed between
the<br>
songs which celebrated real personal struggles in the tiny wars
of the<br>
past, and the songs which were merely the prelude to thousands
of<br>
puzzled young men suddenly finding themselves choking in chlorine
gas,<br>
in the wars of the present.</p>

<p>But even the craziest pacifist could not fail to be moved by
some of the<br>
ballads of the last war. To me, "Tipperary" is still the most
moving<br>
tune in the world. It happens to be a very good tune, from
the<br>
musician's point of view, a tune that Handel would not have been
ashamed<br>
to write, but that is not the point. Its emotional qualities are
due to<br>
its associations. Perhaps that is how it has always been, with
ballads.<br>
From the standard of pure aesthetics, one ought not to
consider<br>
"associations" in judging a poem or a tune, but with a song
like<br>
"Tipperary" you would be an inhuman prig if you didn't. We all
have our<br>
"associations" with this particular tune. For me, it recalls a
window in<br>
Hampstead, on a grey day in October 1914. I had been having the
measles,<br>
and had not been allowed to go back to school. Then suddenly,
down the<br>
street, that tune echoed. And they came marching, and marching,
and<br>
marching. And they were all so happy.</p>

<p>So happy.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"Tipperary" is a true ballad, which is why it is included in
this book.<br>
So is "John Brown's Body". They were not written as ballads but
they<br>
have been promoted to that proud position by popular vote.</p>

<p>It will now be clear, from the foregoing remarks, that there
are<br>
thousands of poems, labelled "ballads" from the eighteenth
century,<br>
through the romantic movement, and onwards, which are not ballads
at<br>
all. Swinburne's ballads, which so shocked our grandparents, bore
about<br>
as much relation to the true ballads as a vase of wax fruit to
a<br>
hawker's barrow. They were lovely patterns of words, woven like
some<br>
exquisite, foaming lace, but they were Swinburne, Swinburne all
the<br>
time. They had nothing to do with the common people. The common
people<br>
would not have understood a word of them.</p>

<p>Ballads <i>must</i> be popular. And that is why it will always
remain<br>
one of the weirdest paradoxes of literature that the only man,
except<br>
Kipling, who has written a true ballad in the last fifty years is
the<br>
man who despised the people, who shrank from them, and jeered at
them,<br>
from his little gilded niche in Piccadilly. I refer, of course,
to Oscar<br>
Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." It was a true ballad, and it
was the<br>
best thing he ever wrote. For it was written <i>de profundis</i>,
when<br>
his hands were bloody with labour and his tortured spirit had
been down<br>
to the level of the lowest, to the level of the pavement ... nay,
lower<br>
... to the gutter itself. And in the gutter, with agony, he
learned the<br>
meaning of song.</p>

<p>Ballads begin and end with the people. You cannot escape that
fact. And<br>
therefore, if I wished to collect the ballads of the future, the
songs<br>
which will endure into the next century (if there <i>is</i> any
song in<br>
the next century), I should not rake through the contemporary
poets, in<br>
the hope of finding gems of lasting brilliance. No. I should go
to the<br>
music-halls. I should listen to the sort of thing they sing when
the<br>
faded lady with the high bust steps forward and shouts, "Now
then, boys,<br>
all together!"</p>

<p>Unless you can write the words "Now then, boys, all together",
at the<br>
top of a ballad, it is not really a ballad at all. That may sound
a<br>
sweeping statement, but it is true.</p>

<p>In the present-day music-halls, although they have fallen from
their<br>
high estate, we should find a number of these songs which seem
destined<br>
for immortality. One of these is "Don't 'ave any more, Mrs.
Moore."</p>

<p>Do you remember it?</p>

<p>  Don't 'ave any more, Mrs. Moore!<br>
  Mrs. Moore, oh don't 'ave any more!<br>
  Too many double gins<br>
  Give the ladies double chins,<br>
  So don't 'ave any more, Mrs. Moore!</p>

<p>The whole of English "low life" (which is much the most
exciting part of<br>
English life) is in that lyric. It is as vivid as a Rowlandson
cartoon.<br>
How well we know Mrs. Moore! How plainly we see her ... the
amiable,<br>
coarse-mouthed, generous-hearted tippler, with her elbow on
countless<br>
counters, her damp coppers clutched in her rough hands, her
eyes<br>
staring, a little vacantly, about her. Some may think it is a
sordid<br>
picture, but I am sure that they cannot know Mrs. Moore very well
if<br>
they think that. They cannot know her bitter struggles, her
silent<br>
heroisms, nor her sardonic humour.</p>

<p>Lyrics such as these will, I believe, endure long after many
of the most<br>
renowned and fashionable poets of to-day are forgotten. They all
have<br>
the same quality, that they can be prefaced by that inspiring
sentence,<br>
"Now then, boys--all together!" Or to put it another way, as in
the<br>
ballad of George Barnwell,</p>

<p>  All youths of fair England<br>
  That dwell both far and near,<br>
  Regard my story that I tell<br>
  And to my song give ear.</p>

<p>That may sound more dignified, but it amounts to the same
thing!</p>
<br><br>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>But if the generation to come will learn a great deal from the
few<br>
popular ballads which we are still creating in our music-halls,
how much<br>
more shall we learn of history from these ballads, which rang
through<br>
the whole country, and were impregnated with the spirit of a
whole<br>
people! These ballads <i>are</i> history, and as such they should
be<br>
recognised.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that we teach history in the wrong
way. We<br>
give boys the impression that it is an affair only of kings and
queens<br>
and great statesmen, of generals and admirals, and such-like
bores.<br>
Thousands of boys could probably draw you a map of many
pettifogging<br>
little campaigns, with startling accuracy, but not one in a
thousand<br>
could tell you what the private soldier carried in his knapsack.
You<br>
could get sheaves of competent essays, from any school, dealing
with<br>
such things as the Elizabethan ecclesiastical settlement, but how
many<br>
boys could tell you, even vaguely, what an English home was like,
what<br>
they ate, what coins were used, how their rooms were lit, and
what they<br>
paid their servants?</p>

<p>In other words, how many history masters ever take the trouble
to sketch<br>
in the great background, the life of the common people? How many
even<br>
realize their <i>existence</i>, except on occasions of
national<br>
disaster, such as the Black Plague?</p>

<p>A proper study of the ballads would go a long way towards
remedying this<br>
defect. Thomas Percy, whose <i>Reliques</i> must ever be the main
source<br>
of our information on all questions connected with ballads, has
pointed<br>
out that all the great events of the country have, sooner or
later,<br>
found their way into the country's song-book. But it is not only
the<br>
resounding names that are celebrated. In the ballads we hear the
echoes<br>
of the street, the rude laughter and the pointed jests. Sometimes
these<br>
ring so plainly that they need no explanation. At other times, we
have<br>
to go to Percy or to some of his successors to realize the
true<br>
significance of the song.</p>

<p>For example, the famous ballad "John Anderson my Jo" seems, at
first<br>
sight, to be innocent of any polemical intention. But it was
written<br>
during the Reformation when, as Percy dryly observes, "the Muses
were<br>
deeply engaged in religious controversy." The zeal of the
Scottish<br>
reformers was at its height, and this zeal found vent in many a
pasquil<br>
discharged at Popery. It caused them, indeed, in their frenzy,
to<br>
compose songs which were grossly licentious, and to sing these
songs in<br>
rasping voices to the tunes of some of the most popular hymns in
the<br>
Latin Service.</p>

<p>"John Anderson my Jo" was such a ballad composed for such an
occasion.<br>
And Percy, who was more qualified than any other man to read
between the<br>
lines, has pointed out that the first stanza contains a
satirical<br>
allusion to the luxury of the popish clergy, while the second,
which<br>
makes an apparently light reference to "seven bairns", is
actually<br>
concerned with the seven sacraments, five of which were the
spurious<br>
offspring of Mother Church.</p>

<p>Thus it was in a thousand cases. The ballads, even the
lightest and most<br>
blossoming of them, were deep-rooted in the soil of English
history. How<br>
different from anything that we possess to-day! Great causes do
not lead<br>
men to song, nowadays they lead them to write letters to the
newspapers.<br>
A national thanksgiving cannot call forth a single rhyme or a
single bar<br>
of music. Who can remember a solitary verse of thanksgiving, from
any of<br>
our poets, in commemoration of any of the victories of the Great
War?<br>
Who can recall even a fragment of verse in praise of the
long-deferred<br>
coming of Peace?</p>

<p>Very deeply significant is it that our only method of
commemorating<br>
Armistice Day was by a two minutes silence. No song. No music.
Nothing.<br>
The best thing we could do, we felt, was to keep quiet.</p>

<h2><a name="THE FROLICKSOME DUKE">THE FROLICKSOME DUKE</a></h2>

<p>or</p>

<h3>THE TINKER'S GOOD FORTUNE</h3>
<img alt="036.jpg (17K)" src="images/036.jpg" height="193" width="240">
<br><br>

<p>  Now as fame does report a young duke keeps a court,<br>
  One that pleases his fancy with frolicksome sport:<br>
  But amongst all the rest, here is one I protest,<br>
  Which will make you to smile when you hear the true jest:<br>
  A poor tinker he found, lying drunk on the ground,<br>
  As secure in a sleep as if laid in a swound.</p>

<p>  The Duke said to his men, William, Richard, and Ben,<br>
  Take him home to my palace, we'll sport with him then.<br>
  O'er a horse he was laid, and with care soon convey'd<br>
  To the palace, altho' he was poorly arrai'd:<br>
  Then they stript off his cloaths, both his shirt, shoes and
hose,<br>
  And they put him to bed for to take his repose.</p>

<p>  Having pull'd off his shirt, which was all over durt,<br>
  They did give him clean holland, this was no great hurt:<br>
  On a bed of soft down, like a lord of renown,<br>
  They did lay him to sleep the drink out of his crown.<br>
  In the morning when day, then admiring he lay,<br>
  For to see the rich chamber both gaudy and gay.</p>

<p>  Now he lay something late, in his rich bed of state,<br>
  Till at last knights and squires they on him did wait;<br>
  And the chamberling bare, then did likewise declare,<br>
  He desired to know what apparel he'd ware:<br>
  The poor tinker amaz'd on the gentleman gaz'd,<br>
  And admired how he to this honour was rais'd.</p>

<p>  Tho' he seem'd something mute, yet he chose a rich suit,<br>
  Which he straitways put on without longer dispute;<br>
  With a star on his side, which the tinker offt ey'd,<br>
  And it seem'd for to swell him "no" little with pride;<br>
  For he said to himself, Where is Joan my sweet wife?<br>
  Sure she never did see me so fine in her life.</p>

<p>  From a convenient place, the right duke his good grace<br>
  Did observe his behaviour in every case.<br>
  To a garden of state, on the tinker they wait,<br>
  Trumpets sounding before him: thought he, this is great:<br>
  Where an hour or two, pleasant walks he did view,<br>
  With commanders and squires in scarlet and blew.</p>

<p>  A fine dinner was drest, both for him and his guests,<br>
  He was plac'd at the table above all the rest,<br>
  In a rich chair "or bed," lin'd with fine crimson red,<br>
  With a rich golden canopy over his head:<br>
  As he sat at his meat, the musick play'd sweet,<br>
  With the choicest of singing his joys to compleat.</p>

<p>  While the tinker did dine, he had plenty of wine,<br>
  Rich canary with sherry and tent superfine.<br>
  Like a right honest soul, faith, he took off his bowl,<br>
  Till at last he began for to tumble and roul<br>
  From his chair to the floor, where he sleeping did snore,<br>
  Being seven times drunker than ever before.</p>

<p>  Then the duke did ordain, they should strip him amain,<br>
  And restore him his old leather garments again:<br>
  'T was a point next the worst, yet perform it they must,<br>
  And they carry'd him strait, where they found him at first;<br>
  There he slept all the night, as indeed well he might;<br>
  But when he did waken, his joys took their flight.</p>

<p>  For his glory "to him" so pleasant did seem,<br>
  That he thought it to be but a meer golden dream;<br>
  Till at length he was brought to the duke, where he sought<br>
  For a pardon, as fearing he had set him at nought;<br>
  But his highness he said, Thou 'rt a jolly bold blade,<br>
  Such a frolick before I think never was plaid.</p>

<p>  Then his highness bespoke him a new suit and cloak,<br>
  Which he gave for the sake of this frolicksome joak;<br>
  Nay, and five-hundred pound, with ten acres of ground,<br>
  Thou shalt never, said he, range the counteries round,<br>
  Crying old brass to mend, for I'll be thy good friend,<br>
  Nay, and Joan thy sweet wife shall my duchess attend.</p>

<p>  Then the tinker reply'd, What! must Joan my sweet bride<br>
  Be a lady in chariots of pleasure to ride?<br>
  Must we have gold and land ev'ry day at command?<br>
  Then I shall be a squire I well understand:<br>
  Well I thank your good grace, and your love I embrace,<br>
  I was never before in so happy a case.</p>

<p>  There was a shepherd's daughter<br>

  And there by chance a knighte shee mett,<br>
    Which caused her to staye.</p>

<p>  Good morrowe to you, beauteous maide,<br>

    He wold not be withstood."</p>

<p>  Sith you have had your wille of mee,<br>

  Now, if you are a courteous knighte,<br>
    Tell me what is your name?</p>

<p>  Some do call mee Jacke, sweet heart,<br>
    And some do call mee Jille;<br>

<p>  He sett his foot into the stirrup,<br>

  She tuckt her girdle about her middle,<br>
    And ranne close by his side.</p>

<p>  But when she came to the brode water,<br>
    She sett her brest and swamme;<br>

    She tooke to her heels and ranne.</p>

<p>  He never was the courteous knighte,<br>

<p>  When she came to the kings faire courte,<br>
    She knocked at the ring;<br>

<p>  Now Christ you save, my gracious liege,<br>
    Now Christ you save and see,<br>
  You have a knighte within your courte,<br>

<p>  What hath he robbed thee of, sweet heart?<br>
    Of purple or of pall?<br>
  Or hath he took thy gaye gold ring<br>
    From off thy finger small?</p>

<p>  He hath not robbed mee, my liege,<br>
    Of purple nor of pall:<br>
  But he hath gotten my maiden head,<br>
    Which grieves mee worst of all.</p>

<p>  Now if he be a batchelor,<br>
    His bodye He give to thee;<br>
  But if he be a married man,<br>
    High hanged he shall bee.</p>

<p>  He called downe his merrye men all,<br>

    Hanged low downe to her knee;<br>
  And everye ring on her small fing&egrave;r<br>
    Shone of the chrystall free.</p>

<p>  Saies, God you save, my deere madam;<br>
    Saies, God you save and see.<br>
  Said, You be welcome, kyng Estmere,<br>
    Right welcome unto mee.</p>

<p>  And if you love me, as you saye,<br>
    Soe well and hartilye,<br>
  All that ever you are comin about<br>
    Sooner sped now itt shal bee.</p>

<p>  Then bespake her father deare:<br>
    My daughter, I saye naye;<br>
  Remember well the kyng of Spayne,<br>
    What he sayd yesterday.</p>

<p>  He wold pull downe my hales and castles,<br>
     And reeve me of my life.<br>
  I cannot blame him if he doe,<br>
     If I reave him of his wyfe.</p>

<p>  Your castles and your towres, father,<br>
     Are stronglye built aboute;<br>
  And therefore of the king of Spaine<br>
     Wee neede not stande in doubt.</p>

<p>  Plight me your troth, nowe, kyng Estm&egrave;re,<br>
     By heaven and your righte hand,<br>
  That you will marrye me to your wyfe,<br>
     And make me queene of your land.</p>

<p>  Then kyng Estmere he plight his troth<br>
     By heaven and his righte hand,<br>
  That he wolde marrye her to his wyfe,<br>
     And make her queene of his land.</p>

<p>  And he tooke leave of that ladye fayre,<br>
     To goe to his owne countree,<br>
  To fetche him dukes and lordes and knightes,<br>
     That marryed the might bee.</p>

<p>  They had not ridden scant a myle,<br>
     A myle forthe of the towne,<br>
  But in did come the kyng of Spayne,<br>
     With kemp&egrave;s many one.</p>

<p>  But in did come the kyng of Spayne,<br>
     With manye a bold barone,<br>
  Tone day to marrye kyng Adlands daughter,<br>
     Tother daye to carrye her home.</p>

<p>  Shee sent one after kyng Estmere<br>
     In all the spede might bee,<br>
  That he must either turne againe and fighte,<br>
     Or goe home and loose his ladye.</p>

  Tull he had oretaken king Estmere,<br>

<p>  Tydings, tydings, kyng Estmere!<br>
     What tydinges nowe, my boye?<br>
  O tydinges I can tell to you,<br>
     That will you sore annoye.</p>

<p>  You had not ridden scant a mile,<br>
     A mile out of the towne,<br>
  But in did come the kyng of Spayne<br>
     With kemp&egrave;s many a one:</p>

<p>  But in did come the kyng of Spayne<br>
     With manye a bold barone,<br>
  Tone daye to marrye king Adlands daughter,<br>
     Tother daye to carry her home.</p>

<p>  My ladye fayre she greetes you well,<br>
   And ever-more well by mee:<br>
  You must either turne againe and fighte,<br>
   Or goe home and loose your lady&egrave;.</p>

<p>  Saies, Reade me, reade me, deere brother,<br>
   My reade shall ryde at thee,<br>
  Whether it is better to turne and fighte,<br>
   Or goe home and loose my ladye.</p>

<p>  Now hearken to me, sayes Adler yonge,<br>
   And your reade must rise at me,<br>
  I quicklye will devise a waye<br>
   To sette thy ladye free.</p>

<p>  My mother was a westerne woman,<br>
   And learned in gramary&egrave;,<br>
  And when I learned at the schole,<br>
   Something she taught itt mee.</p>

<p>  There growes an hearbe within this field,<br>
   And iff it were but knowne,<br>
  His color, which is whyte and redd,<br>
   It will make blacke and browne:</p>

<p>  His color, which is browne and blacke,<br>
   Itt will make redd and whyte;<br>
  That sworde is not in all Englande,<br>
   Upon his coate will byte.</p>

<p>  And you shall be a harper, brother,<br>
    Out of the north countrye;<br>
  And He be your boy, soe faine of fighte,<br>
    And beare your harpe by your knee.</p>

<p>  And you shal be the best harp&egrave;r,<br>
    That ever tooke harpe in hand;<br>
  And I wil be the best sing&egrave;r,<br>
    That ever sung in this lande.</p>

<p>  Itt shal be written on our forheads<br>
    All and in grammary&egrave;,<br>
  That we towe are the boldest men,<br>
    That are in all Christenty&egrave;.</p>

<p>  And thus they renisht them to ryde,<br>
    On tow good renish steedes;<br>
  And when they came to king Adlands hall,<br>
    Of redd gold shone their weedes.</p>

<p>  And whan they came to kyng Adlands hall,<br>
    Untill the fayre hall yate,<br>
  There they found a proud port&egrave;r<br>
    Rearing himselfe thereatt.</p>

<p>  Sayes, Christ thee save, thou proud port&egrave;r;<br>
    Sayes, Christ thee save and see.<br>
  Nowe you be welcome, sayd the port&egrave;r,<br>
    Of whatsoever land ye bee.</p>

<p>  Wee beene harpers, sayd Adler younge,<br>
    Come out of the northe countrye;<br>
  Wee beene come hither untill this place,<br>
    This proud weddinge for to see.</p>

<p>  Sayd, And your color were white and redd,<br>
    As it is blacke and browne,<br>
  I wold saye king Estmere and his brother,<br>
    Were comen untill this towne.</p>

<p>  Then they pulled out a ryng of gold,<br>
    Layd itt on the porters arme:<br>
  And ever we will thee, proud porter,<br>
    Thow wilt saye us no harme.</p>

<p>  Sore he looked on king Estmere,<br>
    And sore he handled the ryng,<br>
  Then opened to them the fayre hall yates,<br>
    He lett for no kind of thyng.</p>

<p>  King Estmere he stabled his steede<br>
    Soe fayre att the hall bord;<br>
  The froth, that came from his brydle bitte,<br>
    Light in kyng Bremors beard.</p>

<p>  Saies, Stable thy steed, thou proud harper,<br>
    Saies, Stable him in the stalle;<br>
  It doth not beseeme a proud harper<br>
    To stable 'him' in a kyngs halle.</p>

<p>  My ladde he is no lither, he said,<br>
    He will doe nought that's meete;<br>
  And is there any man in this hall<br>
    Were able him to beate</p>

<p>  Thou speakst proud words, sayes the king of Spaine,<br>
    Thou harper, here to mee:<br>
  There is a man within this halle<br>
    Will beate thy ladd and thee.</p>

<p>  O let that man come downe, he said,<br>
    A sight of him wold I see;<br>
  And when hee hath beaten well my ladd,<br>
    Then he shall beate of mee.</p>

<p>  Downe then came the kemperye man,<br>
    And looketh him in the eare;<br>
  For all the gold, that was under heaven,<br>
    He durst not neigh him neare.</p>

<p>  And how nowe, kempe, said the Kyng of Spaine,<br>
    And how what aileth thee?<br>
  He saies, It is writt in his forhead<br>
    All and in gramary&egrave;,<br>
  That for all the gold that is under heaven<br>
    I dare not neigh him nye.</p>

<p>  Then Kyng Estmere pulld forth his harpe,<br>
    And plaid a pretty thinge:<br>
  The ladye upstart from the borde,<br>
    And wold have gone from the king.</p>

<p>  Stay thy harpe, thou proud harper,<br>
    For Gods love I pray thee,<br>
  For and thou playes as thou beginns,<br>
    Thou'lt till my bryde from mee.</p>

<p>  He stroake upon his harpe againe,<br>
    And playd a pretty thinge;<br>
  The ladye lough a loud laughter,<br>
    As shee sate by the king.</p>

<p>  Saies, Sell me thy harpe, thou proud harper,<br>
    And thy stringes all,<br>
  For as many gold nobles 'thou shall have'<br>
    As heere bee ringes in the hall.</p>

<p>  What wold ye doe with my harpe,' he sayd,'<br>
    If I did sell itt yee?<br>
  "To playe my wiffe and me a fitt,<br>
    When abed together wee bee."</p>

<p>  Now sell me, quoth hee, thy bryde soe gay,<br>
    As shee sitts by thy knee,<br>
  And as many gold nobles I will give,<br>
    As leaves been on a tree.</p>

<p>  And what wold ye doe with my bryde soe gay,<br>
    Iff I did sell her thee?<br>
  More seemelye it is for her fayre bodye<br>
    To lye by mee then thee.</p>

<p>  Hee played agayne both loud and shrille,<br>
    And Adler he did syng,<br>
  "O ladye, this is thy owne true love;<br>
    Noe harper, but a kyng.</p>

<p>  "O ladye, this is thy owne true love,<br>
    As playnlye thou mayest see;<br>
  And He rid thee of that foule paynim,<br>
    Who partes thy love and thee."</p>

<p>  The ladye looked, the ladye blushte,<br>
    And blushte and lookt agayne,<br>
  While Adler he hath drawne his brande,<br>
    And hath the Sowdan slayne.</p>

<p>  Up then rose the kemperye men,<br>
    And loud they gan to crye:<br>
  Ah; traytors, yee have slayne our kyng,<br>
    And therefore yee shall dye.</p>

<p>  Kyng Estmere threwe the harpe asyde,<br>
    And swith he drew his brand;<br>
  And Estmere he, and Adler yonge<br>
    Right stiffe in slodr can stand.</p>

<p>  And aye their swordes soe sore can byte,<br>
    Throughe help of Gramary&egrave;,<br>
  That soone they have slayne the kempery men,<br>
    Or forst them forth to flee.</p>

<p>  Kyng Estmere took that fayre ladye,<br>
    And marryed her to his wiffe,<br>
  And brought her home to merry England<br>
    With her to leade his life.</p>

<img alt="058.jpg (15K)" src="images/058.jpg" height="187" width="239">
<br><br>
<p>  An ancient story Ile tell you anon<br>
  Of a notable prince, that was called King John;<br>
  And he ruled England with maine and with might,<br>
  For he did great wrong, and maintein'd little right.</p>

<p>  And Ile tell you a story, a story so merrye,<br>
  Concerning the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;rye;<br>
  How for his house-keeping, and high renowne,<br>
  They rode poste for him to fair London towne.</p>

<p>  An hundred men, the king did heare say,<br>
  The abbot kept in his house every day;<br>
  And fifty golde chaynes, without any doubt,<br>
  In velvet coates waited the abbot about.</p>

<p>  How now, father abbot, I heare it of thee,<br>
  Thou keepest a farre better house than mee,<br>
  And for thy house-keeping and high renowne,<br>
  I feare thou work'st treason against my crown.</p>

<p>  My liege, quo' the abbot, I would it were knowne,<br>
  I never spend nothing, but what is my owne;<br>
  And I trust, your grace will doe me no deere,<br>
  For spending of my owne true-gotten geere.</p>

<p>  Yes, yes, father abbot, thy fault it is highe,<br>
  And now for the same thou needest must dye;<br>
  For except thou canst answer me questions three,<br>
  Thy head shall be smitten from thy bod&igrave;e.</p>

<p>  And first, quo' the king, when I'm in this stead,<br>
  With my crowne of golde so faire on my head,<br>
  Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br>
  Thou must tell me to one penny what I am worthe.</p>

<p>  Secondlye, tell me, without any doubt,<br>
  How soone I may ride the whole world about.<br>
  And at the third question thou must not shrink,<br>
  But tell me here truly what I do think.</p>

<p>  O, these are hard questions for my shallow witt,<br>
  Nor I cannot answer your grace as yet:<br>
  But if you will give me but three weekes space,<br>
  Ile do my endeavour to answer your grace.</p>

<p>  Now three weeks space to thee will I give,<br>
  And that is the longest time thou hast to live;<br>
  For if thou dost not answer my questions three,<br>
  Thy lands and thy livings are forfeit to mee.</p>

<p>  Away rode the abbot all sad at that word,<br>
  And he rode to Cambridge, and Oxenford;<br>
  But never a doctor there was so wise,<br>
  That could with his learning an answer devise.</p>

<p>  Then home rode the abbot of comfort so cold,<br>
  And he mett his shepheard a going to fold:<br>
  How now, my lord abbot, you are welcome home;<br>
  What newes do you bring us from good King John?</p>

<p>  "Sad newes, sad newes, shepheard, I must give;<br>
  That I have but three days more to live:<br>
  For if I do not answer him questions three,<br>
  My head will be smitten from my bodie.</p>

<p>  The first is to tell him there in that stead,<br>
  With his crowne of golde so fair on his head,<br>
  Among all his liege men so noble of birth,<br>
  To within one penny of all what he is worth.</p>

<p>  The seconde, to tell him, without any doubt,<br>
  How soon he may ride this whole world about:<br>
  And at the third question I must not shrinke,<br>
  But tell him there truly what he does thinke."</p>

<p>  Now cheare up, sire abbot, did you never hear yet,<br>
  That a fool he may learn a wise man witt?<br>
  Lend me horse, and serving men, and your apparel,<br>
  And I'll ride to London to answere your quarrel.</p>

<p>  Nay frowne not, if it hath bin told unto mee,<br>
  I am like your lordship, as ever may bee:<br>
  And if you will but lend me your gowne,<br>
  There is none shall knowe us at fair London towne.</p>

<p>  Now horses, and serving-men thou shalt have,<br>
  With sumptuous array most gallant and brave;<br>
  With crozier, and miter, and rochet, and cope,<br>
  Fit to appeare 'fore our fader the pope.</p>

<p>  Now welcome, sire abbott, the king he did say,<br>
  'Tis well thou'rt come back to keep thy day;<br>
  For and if thou canst answer my questions three,<br>
  Thy life and thy living both saved shall bee.</p>

<p>  And first, when thou seest me here in this stead,<br>
  With my crowne of gold so fair on my head,<br>
  Among all my liege-men so noble of birthe,<br>
  Tell me to one penny what I am worth.</p>

<p>  "For thirty pence our Saviour was sold<br>
  Amonge the false Jewes, as I have bin told;<br>
  And twenty nine is the worth of thee,<br>
  For I thinke, thou art one penny worser than hee."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by St. Bittel,<br>
  I did not thinke I had been worth so littel!<br>
  --Now secondly tell me, without any doubt,<br>
  How soon I may ride this whole world about.</p>

<p>  "You must rise with the sun, and ride with the same,<br>
  Until the next morning he riseth againe;<br>
  And then your grace need not make any doubt,<br>
  But in twenty-four hours you'll ride it about."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by St. Jone,<br>
  I did not think, it could be gone so soone!<br>
  --Now from the third question thou must not shrinke,<br>
  But tell me here truly what I do thinke.</p>

<p>  "Yea, that shall I do, and make your grace merry:<br>
  You thinke I'm the Abbot of Canterb&ugrave;ry;<br>
  But I'm his poor shepheard, as plain you may see,<br>
  That am come to beg pardon for him and for mee."</p>

<p>  The king he laughed, and swore by the masse,<br>
  He make thee lord abbot this day in his place!<br>
  "Now naye, my liege, be not in such speede,<br>
  For alacke I can neither write ne reade."</p>

<p>  Four nobles a weeke, then I will give thee,<br>
  For this merry jest thou hast showne unto mee;<br>
  And tell the old abbot, when thou comest home,<br>
  Thou hast brought him a pardon from good King John.</p>

<p>  When as King Henry rulde this land,<br>
    The second of that name,<br>
  Besides the queene, he dearly lovde<br>
    A faire and comely dame.</p>

<p>  Most peerlesse was her beautye founde,<br>
    Her favour, and her face;<br>
  A sweeter creature in this worlde<br>
    Could never prince embrace.</p>

<p>  Her crisped lockes like threads of golde<br>
    Appeard to each mans sight;<br>
  Her sparkling eyes, like Orient pearles,<br>
    Did cast a heavenlye light.</p>

<p>  The blood within her crystal cheekes<br>
    Did such a colour drive,<br>
  As though the lillye and the rose<br>
    For mastership did strive.</p>

<p>  Yea Rosamonde, fair Rosamonde,<br>
    Her name was called so,<br>
  To whom our queene, dame Ellinor,<br>
    Was known a deadlye foe.</p>

<p>  The king therefore, for her defence,<br>
    Against the furious queene,<br>
  At Woodstocke builded such a bower,<br>
    The like was never scene.</p>

<p>  Most curiously that bower was built<br>
    Of stone and timber strong,<br>
  An hundred and fifty doors<br>
   Did to this bower belong:</p>

<p>  And they so cunninglye contriv'd<br>
    With turnings round about,<br>
  That none but with a clue of thread,<br>
    Could enter in or out.</p>

<p>  And for his love and ladyes sake,<br>
    That was so faire and brighte,<br>
  The keeping of this bower he gave<br>
    Unto a valiant knighte.</p>

<p>  But fortune, that doth often frowne<br>
    Where she before did smile,<br>
  The kinges delighte and ladyes so<br>
    Full soon shee did beguile:</p>

<p>  For why, the kinges ungracious sonne,<br>
    Whom he did high advance,<br>
  Against his father raised warres<br>
    Within the realme of France.</p>

<p>  But yet before our comelye king<br>
    The English land forsooke,<br>
  Of Rosamond, his lady faire,<br>
    His farewelle thus he tooke:</p>

<p>  "My Rosamonde, my only Rose,<br>
    That pleasest best mine eye:<br>
  The fairest flower in all the worlde<br>
    To feed my fantasye:</p>

<p>  The flower of mine affected heart,<br>
    Whose sweetness doth excelle:<br>
  My royal Rose, a thousand times<br>
    I bid thee nowe farwelle!</p>

<p>  For I must leave my fairest flower,<br>
    My sweetest Rose, a space,<br>
  And cross the seas to famous France,<br>
    Proud rebelles to abase.</p>

<p>  But yet, my Rose, be sure thou shalt<br>
    My coming shortlye see,<br>
  And in my heart, when hence I am,<br>
    Ile beare my Rose with mee."</p>

<p>  When Rosamond, that ladye brighte,<br>
    Did heare the king saye soe,<br>
  The sorrowe of her grieved heart<br>
    Her outward lookes did showe;</p>

<p>  And from her cleare and crystall eyes<br>
    The teares gusht out apace,<br>
  Which like the silver-pearled dewe<br>
    Ranne downe her comely face.</p>

<p>  Her lippes, erst like the corall redde,<br>
    Did waxe both wan and pale,<br>
  And for the sorrow she conceivde<br>
    Her vitall spirits faile;</p>

<p>  And falling down all in a swoone<br>
    Before King Henryes face,<br>
  Full oft he in his princelye armes<br>
    Her bodye did embrace:</p>

<p>  And twentye times, with watery eyes,<br>
    He kist her tender cheeke,<br>
  Untill he had revivde againe<br>
    Her senses milde and meeke.</p>

<p>  Why grieves my Rose, my sweetest Rose?<br>
    The king did often say.<br>
  Because, quoth shee, to bloodye warres<br>
    My lord must part awaye.</p>

<p>  But since your grace on forrayne coastes<br>
    Amonge your foes unkinde<br>
  Must goe to hazard life and limbe,<br>
    Why should I staye behinde?</p>

<p>  Nay rather, let me, like a page,<br>
    Your sworde and target beare;<br>
  That on my breast the blowes may lighte,<br>
    Which would offend you there.</p>

<p>  Or lett mee, in your royal tent,<br>
    Prepare your bed at nighte,<br>
  And with sweete baths refresh your grace,<br>
    Ar your returne from fighte.</p>

<p>  So I your presence may enjoye<br>
    No toil I will refuse;<br>
  But wanting you, my life is death;<br>
    Nay, death Ild rather chuse!</p>

<p>  "Content thy self, my dearest love;<br>
    Thy rest at home shall bee<br>
  In Englandes sweet and pleasant isle;<br>
    For travell fits not thee.</p>

<p>  Faire ladies brooke not bloodye warres;<br>
    Soft peace their sexe delights;<br>
  Not rugged campes, but courtlye bowers;<br>
    Gay feastes, not cruell fights.'</p>

<p>  My Rose shall safely here abide,<br>
    With musicke passe the daye;<br>
  Whilst I, amonge the piercing pikes,<br>
    My foes seeke far awaye.</p>

<p>  My Rose shall shine in pearle, and golde,<br>
    Whilst Ime in armour dighte;<br>
  Gay galliards here my love shall dance,<br>
    Whilst I my foes goe fighte.</p>

<p>  And you, Sir Thomas, whom I truste<br>
    To bee my loves defence;<br>
  Be careful of my gallant Rose<br>
    When I am parted hence."</p>

<p>  And therewithall he fetcht a sigh,<br>
    As though his heart would breake:<br>
  And Rosamonde, for very grief,<br>
    Not one plaine word could speake.</p>

<p>  And at their parting well they mighte<br>
    In heart be grieved sore:<br>
  After that daye faire Rosamonde<br>
    The king did see no more.</p>

<p>  For when his grace had past the seas,<br>
    And into France was gone;<br>
  With envious heart, Queene Ellinor,<br>
    To Woodstocke came anone.</p>

<p>  And forth she calls this trustye knighte,<br>
    In an unhappy houre;<br>
  Who with his clue of twined thread,<br>
    Came from this famous bower.</p>

<p>  And when that they had wounded him,<br>
    The queene this thread did gette,<br>
  And went where Ladye Rosamonde<br>
    Was like an angell sette.</p>

<p>  But when the queene with stedfast eye<br>
    Beheld her beauteous face,<br>
  She was amazed in her minde<br>
    At her exceeding grace.</p>

<p>  Cast off from thee those robes, she said,<br>
    That riche and costlye bee;<br>
  And drinke thou up this deadlye draught,<br>
    Which I have brought to thee.</p>

<p>  Then presentlye upon her knees<br>
    Sweet Rosamonde did fall;<br>
  And pardon of the queene she crav'd<br>
    For her offences all.</p>

<p>  "Take pitty on my youthfull yeares,"<br>
    Faire Rosamonde did crye;<br>
  "And lett mee not with poison stronge<br>
    Enforced bee to dye.</p>

<p>  I will renounce my sinfull life,<br>
    And in some cloyster bide;<br>
  Or else be banisht, if you please,<br>
    To range the world soe wide.</p>

<p>  And for the fault which I have done,<br>
    Though I was forc'd thereto,<br>
  Preserve my life, and punish mee<br>
    As you thinke meet to doe."</p>

<p>  And with these words, her lillie handes<br>
    She wrunge full often there;<br>
  And downe along her lovely face<br>
    Did trickle many a teare.</p>

<p>  But nothing could this furious queene<br>
    Therewith appeased bee;<br>
  The cup of deadlye poyson stronge,<br>
    As she knelt on her knee,</p>

<p>  Shee gave this comelye dame to drinke;<br>
    Who tooke it in her hand,<br>
  And from her bended knee arose,<br>
    And on her feet did stand:</p>

<p>  And casting up her eyes to heaven,<br>
    She did for mercye calle;<br>
  And drinking up the poison stronge,<br>
    Her life she lost withalle.</p>

<p>  And when that death through everye limbe<br>
    Had showde its greatest spite,<br>
  Her chiefest foes did plaine confesse<br>
    Shee was a glorious wight.</p>

<p>  Her body then they did entomb,<br>
    When life was fled away,<br>
  At Godstowe, neare to Oxford towne,<br>
    As may be scene this day.</p>

<br><br>

<p>  When shaws beene sheene, and shradds full fayre,<br>
    And leaves both large and longe,<br>
  Itt is merrye walking in the fayre forrest<br>
    To heare the small birdes songe.</p>

<p>  The woodweele sang, and wold not cease,<br>
    Sitting upon the spraye,<br>
  Soe lowde, he wakened Robin Hood,<br>
    In the greenwood where he lay.</p>

<p>  Now by my faye, sayd jollye Robin,<br>
    A sweaven I had this night;<br>
  I dreamt me of tow wighty yemen,<br>
    That fast with me can fight.</p>

<p>  Methought they did mee beate and binde,<br>
    And tooke my bow mee froe;<br>
  If I be Robin alive in this lande,<br>
    He be wroken on them towe.</p>

<p>  Sweavens are swift, Master, quoth John,<br>
    As the wind that blowes ore a hill;<br>
  For if itt be never so loude this night,<br>
    To-morrow itt may be still.</p>

<p>  Buske yee, bowne yee, my merry men all,<br>
    And John shall goe with mee,<br>
  For Ile goe seeke yond wight yeomen,<br>
    In greenwood where the bee.</p>

<p>  Then the cast on their gownes of grene,<br>
    And tooke theyr bowes each one;<br>
  And they away to the greene forrest<br>
    A shooting forth are gone;</p>

<p>  Until they came to the merry greenwood,<br>
    Where they had gladdest bee,<br>
  There were the ware of a wight yeoman,<br>
    His body leaned to a tree.</p>

<p>  A sword and a dagger he wore by his side,<br>
    Of manye a man the bane;<br>
  And he was clad in his capull hyde<br>
    Topp and tayll and mayne.</p>

<p>  Stand you still, master, quoth Litle John,<br>
    Under this tree so grene,<br>
  And I will go to yond wight yeoman<br>
    To know what he doth meane.</p>

<p>  Ah! John, by me thou settest noe store,<br>
    And that I farley finde:<br>
  How offt send I my men beffore<br>
    And tarry my selfe behinde?</p>

<p>  It is no cunning a knave to ken,<br>
    And a man but heare him speake;<br>
  And itt were not for bursting of my bowe.<br>
    John, I thy head wold breake.</p>

<p>  As often wordes they breeden bale,<br>
    So they parted Robin and John;<br>
  And John is gone to Barnesdale;<br>
    The gates he knoweth eche one.</p>

<p>  But when he came to Barnesdale,<br>
    Great heavinesse there hee hadd,<br>
  For he found tow of his owne fell&ograve;wes<br>
    Were slaine both in a slade.</p>

<p>  And Scarlette he was flyinge a-foote<br>
    Fast over stocke and stone,<br>
  For the sheriffe with seven score men<br>
    Fast after him is gone.</p>

<p>  One shoote now I will shoote, quoth John,<br>
    With Christ his might and mayne:<br>
  Ile make yond fellow that flyes soe fast,<br>
    To stopp he shall be fayne.</p>

<p>  Then John bent up his long bende-bowe,<br>
    And fetteled him to shoote:<br>
  The bow was made of a tender boughe,<br>
    And fell down to his foote.</p>

<p>  Woe worth, woe worth thee, wicked wood,<br>
    That ere thou grew on a tree;<br>
  For now this day thou art my bale,<br>
    My boote when thou shold bee.</p>

<p>  His shoote it was but loosely shott,<br>
    Yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine,<br>
  For itt mett one of the sheriffes men,<br>
    Good William a Trent was slaine.</p>

<p>  It had bene better of William a Trent<br>
    To have bene abed with sorrowe,<br>
  Than to be that day in the green wood slade<br>
    To meet with Little Johns arrowe.</p>

<p>  But as it is said, when men be mett<br>
    Fyve can doe more than three,<br>
  The sheriffe hath taken little John,<br>
    And bound him fast to a tree.</p>

<p>  Thou shalt be drawen by dale and downe,<br>
    And hanged hye on a hill.<br>
  But thou mayst fayle of thy purpose, quoth John,<br>
    If itt be Christ his will.</p>

<p>  Let us leave talking of Little John,<br>
    And thinke of Robin Hood,<br>
  How he is gone to the wight yeoman,<br>
    Where under the leaves he stood.</p>

<p>  Good morrowe, good fellowe, sayd Robin so fayre,<br>
    Good morrowe, good fellow, quoth he:<br>
   Methinkes by this bowe thou beares in thy hande<br>
    A good archere thou sholdst bee.</p>

<p>  I am wilfull of my waye, quo' the yeman,<br>
    And of my morning tyde.<br>
  He lead thee through the wood, sayd Robin;<br>
    Good fellow, He be thy guide.</p>

<p>  I seeke an outl&agrave;we, the straunger sayd,<br>
    Men call him Robin Hood;<br>
  Rather Ild meet with that proud outlawe,<br>
    Than fortye pound so good.</p>

<p>  Now come with me, thou wighty yeman,<br>
    And Robin thou soone shalt see:<br>
  But first let us some pastime find<br>
    Under the greenwood tree.</p>

<p>  First let us some masterye make<br>
    Among the woods so even,<br>
  Wee may chance to meet with Robin Hood<br>
    Here att some unsett steven.</p>

<p>  They cut them downe two summer shroggs,<br>
    That grew both under a breere,<br>
  And sett them threescore rood in twaine<br>
    To shoot the prickes y-fere:</p>

<p>  Lead on, good fellowe, quoth Robin Hood,<br>
    Lead on, I doe bidd thee.<br>
  Nay by my faith, good fellowe, hee sayd,<br>
    My leader thou shalt bee.</p>

<p>  The first time Robin shot at the pricke,<br>
    He mist but an inch it froe:<br>
  The yeoman he was an archer good,<br>
    But he cold never shoote soe.</p>

<p>  The second shoote had the wightye yeman,<br>
    He shote within the garl&agrave;nde:<br>
  But Robin he shott far better than hee,<br>
    For he clave the good pricke wande.</p>

<p>  A blessing upon thy heart, he sayd;<br>
    Good fellowe, thy shooting is goode;<br>
  For an thy hart be as good as thy hand,<br>
    Thou wert better then Robin Hoode.</p>

<p>  Now tell me thy name, good fellowe, sayd he,<br>
    Under the leaves of lyne.<br>
  Nay by my faith, quoth bolde Robin,<br>
    Till thou have told me thine.</p>

<p>  I dwell by dale and downe, quoth hee,<br>
    And Robin to take Ime sworne;<br>
  And when I am called by my right name<br>
    I am Guye of good Gisborne.</p>

<p>  My dwelling is in this wood, sayes Robin,<br>
    By thee I set right nought:<br>
  I am Robin Hood of Barn&egrave;sdale,<br>
    Whom thou so long hast sought.</p>

<p>  He that hath neither beene kithe nor kin,<br>
    Might have scene a full fayre sight,<br>
  To see how together these yeomen went<br>
    With blades both browne and bright.</p>

<p>  To see how these yeomen together they fought<br>
    Two howres of a summers day:<br>
  Yet neither Robin Hood nor Sir Guy<br>
    Them fettled to flye away.</p>

<p>  Robin was reachles on a roote,<br>
    And stumbled at that tyde;<br>
  And Guy was quick and nimble with-all,<br>
    And hitt him ore the left side.</p>

<p>  Ah deere Lady, sayd Robin Hood, 'thou<br>
    That art both mother and may,'<br>
  I think it was never mans destinye<br>
    To dye before his day.</p>

<p>  Robin thought on our ladye deere,<br>
    And soone leapt up againe,<br>
  And strait he came with a 'backward' stroke,<br>
    And he Sir Guy hath slayne.</p>

<p>  He took Sir Guys head by the hayre,<br>
    And sticked itt on his bowes end:<br>
  Thou hast beene a traytor all thy liffe,<br>
    Which thing must have an ende.</p>

<p>  Robin pulled forth an Irish kniffe,<br>
    And nicked Sir Guy in the face,<br>
  That he was never on woman born,<br>
    Cold tell whose head it was.</p>

<p>  Saies, Lye there, lye there, now Sir Guye,<br>
    And with me be not wrothe,<br>
  If thou have had the worst stroked at my hand,<br>
    Thou shalt have the better clothe.</p>

<p>  Robin did off his gowne of greene,<br>
    And on Sir Guy did it throwe,<br>
  And hee put on that capull hyde,<br>
    That cladd him topp to toe.</p>

<p>  The bowe, the arrowes, and litle home,<br>
    Now with me I will beare;<br>
  For I will away to Barnesdale,<br>
    To see how my men doe fare.</p>

<p>  Robin Hood sett Guyes horne to his mouth.<br>
    And a loud blast in it did blow.<br>
  That beheard the sheriffe of Nottingham,<br>
    As he leaned under a lowe.</p>

<p>  Hearken, hearken, sayd the sheriffe,<br>
    I heare now tydings good,<br>
  For yonder I heare Sir Guyes horne blowe,<br>
    And he hath slaine Robin Hoode.</p>

<p>  Yonder I heare Sir Guyes home blowe,<br>
    Itt blowes soe well in tyde,<br>
  And yonder comes that wightye yeoman,<br>
    Cladd in his capull hyde.</p>

<p>  Come hyther, come hyther, thou good Sir Guy,<br>
    Aske what thou wilt of mee.<br>
  O I will none of thy gold, sayd Robin,<br>
    Nor I will none of thy fee:</p>

<p>  But now I have slaine the master, he sayes,<br>
    Let me go strike the knave;<br>
  This is all the rewarde I aske;<br>
    Nor noe other will I have.</p>

<p>  Thou art a madman, said the sheriffe,<br>
    Thou sholdest have had a knights fee:<br>
  But seeing thy asking hath beene soe bad,<br>
    Well granted it shale be.</p>

<p>  When Litle John heard his master speake,<br>
    Well knewe he it was his steven:<br>
  Now shall I be looset, quoth Litle John,<br>
    With Christ his might in heaven.</p>

<p>  Fast Robin hee hyed him to Litle John,<br>
    He thought to loose him belive;<br>
  The sheriffe and all his companye<br>
    Fast after him did drive.<br>
  Stand abacke, stand abacke, sayd Robin;<br>
    Why draw you mee soe neere?<br>
  Itt was never the use in our countrye,<br>
    Ones shrift another shold heere.</p>

<p>  But Robin pulled forth an Irysh kniffe,<br>
    And losed John hand and foote,<br>
  And gave him Sir Guyes bow into his hand,<br>
    And bade it be his boote.</p>

<p>  Then John he took Guyes bow in his hand,<br>
    His boltes and arrowes eche one:<br>
  When the sheriffe saw Little John bend his bow,<br>
    He fettled him to be gone.</p>

<p>  Towards his house in Nottingham towne<br>
    He fled full fast away;<br>
  And soe did all his companye:<br>
    Not one behind wold stay.</p>

<p>  But he cold neither runne soe fast,<br>
    Nor away soe fast cold ryde,<br>
  But Litle John with an arrowe soe broad<br>
    He shott him into the 'back'-syde.</p>

<p>  In Carleile dwelt King Arthur,<br>
    A prince of passing might;<br>
  And there maintain'd his table round,<br>
    Beset with many a knight.</p>

<p>  And there he kept his Christmas<br>
    With mirth and princely cheare,<br>
  When, lo! a straunge and cunning boy<br>
    Before him did appeare.</p>

<p>  A kirtle and a mantle<br>
    This boy had him upon,<br>
  With brooches, rings, and owches,<br>
    Full daintily bedone.</p>

<p>  He had a sarke of silk<br>
    About his middle meet;<br>
  And thus, with seemely curtesy,<br>
    He did King Arthur greet.</p>

<p>  "God speed thee, brave King Arthur,<br>
    Thus feasting in thy bowre;<br>
  And Guenever thy goodly queen,<br>
    That fair and peerlesse flowre.</p>

<p>  "Ye gallant lords, and lordings,<br>
    I wish you all take heed,<br>
  Lest, what ye deem a blooming rose,<br>
    Should prove a cankred weed."</p>

<p>  Then straitway from his bosome<br>
    A little wand he drew;<br>
  And with it eke a mantle<br>
    Of wondrous shape and hew.</p>

<p>  "Now have you here, King Arthur,<br>
   Have this here of mee,<br>
  And give unto thy comely queen,<br>
   All-shapen as you see.</p>

<p>  "No wife it shall become,<br>
    That once hath been to blame."<br>
  Then every knight in Arthur's court<br>
    Slye glaunced at his dame.</p>

<p>  And first came Lady Guenever,<br>
    The mantle she must trye.<br>
  This dame, she was new-fangled,<br>
    And of a roving eye.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    And all was with it cladde,<br>
  From top to toe it shiver'd down,<br>
    As tho' with sheers beshradde.</p>

<p>  One while it was too long,<br>
    Another while too short,<br>
  And wrinkled on her shoulders<br>
    In most unseemly sort.</p>

<p>  Now green, now red it seemed,<br>
    Then all of sable hue.<br>
  "Beshrew me," quoth King Arthur,<br>
    "I think thou beest not true."</p>

<p>  Down she threw the mantle,<br>
    Ne longer would not stay;<br>
  But, storming like a fury,<br>
    To her chamber flung away.</p>

<p>  She curst the whoreson weaver,<br>
    That had the mantle wrought:<br>
  And doubly curst the froward impe,<br>
    Who thither had it brought.</p>

<p>  "I had rather live in desarts<br>
    Beneath the green-wood tree;<br>
  Than here, base king, among thy groomes,<br>
    The sport of them and thee."</p>

<p>  Sir Kay call'd forth his lady,<br>
    And bade her to come near:<br>
  "Yet, dame, if thou be guilty,<br>
    I pray thee now forbear."</p>

<p>  This lady, pertly gigling,<br>
    With forward step came on,<br>
  And boldly to the little boy<br>
    With fearless face is gone.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    With purpose for to wear;<br>
  It shrunk up to her shoulder,<br>
    And left her b--- side bare.</p>

<p>  Then every merry knight,<br>
    That was in Arthur's court,<br>
  Gib'd, and laught, and flouted,<br>
    To see that pleasant sport.</p>

<p>  Downe she threw the mantle,<br>
    No longer bold or gay,<br>
  But with a face all pale and wan,<br>
    To her chamber slunk away.</p>

<p>  Then forth came an old knight,<br>
    A pattering o'er his creed;<br>
  And proffer'd to the little boy<br>
    Five nobles to his meed;</p>

<p>  "And all the time of Christmass<br>
    Plumb-porridge shall be thine,<br>
  If thou wilt let my lady fair<br>
    Within the mantle shine."</p>

<p>  A saint his lady seemed,<br>
    With step demure and slow,<br>
  And gravely to the mantle<br>
    With mincing pace doth goe.</p>

<p>  When she the same had taken,<br>
    That was so fine and thin,<br>
  It shrivell'd all about her,<br>
    And show'd her dainty skin.</p>

<p>  Ah! little did HER mincing,<br>
    Or HIS long prayers bestead;<br>
  She had no more hung on her,<br>
    Than a tassel and a thread.</p>

<p>  Down she threwe the mantle,<br>
    With terror and dismay,<br>
  And, with a face of scarlet,<br>
    To her chamber hyed away.</p>

<p>  Sir Cradock call'd his lady,<br>
    And bade her to come neare:<br>
  "Come, win this mantle, lady,<br>
    And do me credit here.</p>

<p>  "Come, win this mantle, lady,<br>
    For now it shall be thine,<br>
  If thou hast never done amiss,<br>
    Sith first I made thee mine."</p>

<p>  The lady, gently blushing,<br>
    With modest grace came on,<br>
  And now to trye the wondrous charm<br>
    Courageously is gone.</p>

<p>  When she had tane the mantle,<br>
    And put it on her backe,<br>
  About the hem it seemed<br>
    To wrinkle and to cracke.</p>

<p>  "Lye still," shee cryed, "O mantle!<br>
    And shame me not for nought,<br>
  I'll freely own whate'er amiss,<br>
    Or blameful I have wrought.</p>

<p>  "Once I kist Sir Cradocke<br>
    Beneathe the green-wood tree:<br>
  Once I kist Sir Cradocke's mouth<br>
    Before he married mee."</p>

<p>  When thus she had her shriven,<br>
    And her worst fault had told,<br>
  The mantle soon became her<br>
    Right comely as it shold.</p>

<p>  Most rich and fair of colour,<br>
    Like gold it glittering shone:<br>
  And much the knights in Arthur's court<br>
    Admir'd her every one.</p>

<p>  Then towards King Arthur's table<br>
    The boy he turn'd his eye:<br>
  Where stood a boar's head garnished<br>
    With bayes and rosemarye.</p>

<p>  When thrice he o'er the boar's head<br>
    His little wand had drawne,<br>
  Quoth he, "There's never a cuckold's knife<br>
    Can carve this head of brawne."</p>

<p>  Then some their whittles rubbed<br>
    On whetstone, and on hone:<br>
  Some threwe them under the table,<br>
    And swore that they had none.</p>

<p>  Sir Cradock had a little knife,<br>
    Of steel and iron made;<br>
  And in an instant thro' the skull<br>
    He thrust the shining blade.</p>

<p>  He thrust the shining blade<br>
    Full easily and fast;<br>
  And every knight in Arthur's court<br>
    A morsel had to taste.</p>

<p>  The boy brought forth a horne,<br>
    All golden was the rim:<br>
  Saith he, "No cuckolde ever can<br>
    Set mouth unto the brim.</p>

<p>  "No cuckold can this little horne<br>
    Lift fairly to his head;<br>
  But or on this, or that side,<br>
    He shall the liquor shed."</p>

<p>  Some shed it on their shoulder,<br>
    Some shed it on their thigh;<br>
  And hee that could not hit his mouth,<br>
    Was sure to hit his eye.</p>

<p>  Thus he, that was a cuckold,<br>
    Was known of every man:<br>
  But Cradock lifted easily,<br>
    And wan the golden can.</p>

<p>  Thus boar's head, horn and mantle,<br>
    Were this fair couple's meed:<br>
  And all such constant lovers,<br>
    God send them well to speed.</p>

<p>  Then down in rage came Guenever,<br>
    And thus could spightful say,<br>
  "Sir Cradock's wife most wrongfully<br>
    Hath borne the prize away.</p>

<p>  "See yonder shameless woman,<br>
    That makes herselfe so clean:<br>
  Yet from her pillow taken<br>
    Thrice five gallants have been.</p>

<p>  "Priests, clarkes, and wedded men,<br>
    Have her lewd pillow prest:<br>
  Yet she the wonderous prize forsooth<br>
    Must beare from all the rest."</p>

<p>  Then bespake the little boy,<br>
    Who had the same in hold:<br>
  "Chastize thy wife, King Arthur,<br>
    Of speech she is too bold:</p>

<p>  "Of speech she is too bold,<br>
    Of carriage all too free;<br>
  Sir King, she hath within thy hall<br>
    A cuckold made of thee.</p>

<p>  "All frolick light and wanton<br>
    She hath her carriage borne:<br>
  And given thee for a kingly crown<br>
    To wear a cuckold's horne."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
